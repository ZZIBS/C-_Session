#  C++_Session 
 * This is the Session (Practice of my c++ program) 
                              
                              
                              // The main aim of this Project is::  //
        
          This project aim at developing a library application. This will allow us to use C++ and learn about object oriented programming.
          
          Organisation : This is a project so there will be no classical lesson and student are expected to work by themself. They are expected to organize by them self to work on their project and ask the teacher if they have questions. Students are also encouraged to exchange informations among themselfs.
          
          Evaluation : Students will be evaluated regarding the following criterias :
            • Capacity of being autonomous, to self-organize and find solutions/informations by themselfs 
            • Technical realisation (program in C++) 
            • Documentation (this document) and communication


                               // How to use //
         All the information needed is given in the coding. You can edit / modify the code from the given session.
         If there is any errors then give the comments on there which helps me to understand later.
